# Group Project Colab Notebooks

This repository contains all Colab notebooks created for the group project, covering three distinct machine learning projects. Each notebook includes detailed code, explanations, and results for each respective task.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Diabetes Prediction**
   - **Objective:** Predict whether a person has diabetes based on various health metrics and attributes.
   - **Dataset:** Uses a medical dataset with features such as age, blood pressure, glucose levels, BMI, and others.
   - **Techniques:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest).
   - **Outcome:** A predictive model that helps assess the risk of diabetes.

### 2. **Product Recommendation System**
   - **Objective:** Develop a recommendation system to suggest relevant products to users based on their past interactions.
   - **Dataset:** User-product interactions, potentially including user ratings, browsing history, or purchase records.
   - **Techniques:** Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches for personalized recommendations.
   - **Outcome:** A system capable of suggesting products that align with the userâ€™s preferences.

### 3. **Twitter Sentiment Analysis**
   - **Objective:** Analyze the sentiment of tweets to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral.
   - **Dataset:** Collection of tweets with labeled sentiments.
   - **Techniques:** Text preprocessing, natural language processing (NLP), and sentiment classification using machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes or deep learning models.
   - **Outcome:** A model that interprets and classifies the sentiments of tweets, which can be used for social media monitoring or brand analysis.

## Usage

Each notebook can be run independently in Google Colab. Clone the repository and open the desired notebook in Colab to explore each project.

## Requirements

Each notebook lists the necessary libraries, with installation instructions if additional libraries are required. All dependencies are compatible with Python 3 and can be installed within Colab as needed.
