   ### 1. **Diabetes Prediction**
   - **Objective:** Predict whether a person has diabetes based on various health metrics and attributes.
   - **Dataset:** Uses a medical dataset with features such as age, blood pressure, glucose levels, BMI, and others.
   - **Techniques:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest).
   - **Outcome:** A predictive model that helps assess the risk of diabetes.

   ### 2. **Product Recommendation System**
   - **Objective:** Develop a recommendation system to suggest relevant products to users based on their past interactions.
   - **Dataset:** User-product interactions, potentially including user ratings, browsing history, or purchase records.
   - **Techniques:** Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches for personalized recommendations.
   - **Outcome:** A system capable of suggesting products that align with the userâ€™s preferences.

   ### 3. **Twitter Sentiment Analysis**
   - **Objective:** Analyze the sentiment of tweets to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral.
   - **Dataset:** Collection of tweets with labeled sentiments.
   - **Techniques:** Text preprocessing, natural language processing (NLP), and sentiment classification using machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes or deep learning models.
   - **Outcome:** A model that interprets and classifies the sentiments of tweets, which can be used for social media monitoring or brand analysis.

   ### 1. **Text Classification Analysis**
   - **Objective**: To apply feature engineering on text data to transform it into structured features for similarity and clustering analysis.
   - **Dataset**: A small collection of text documents covering various topics designed to test the effectiveness of different text representation techniques.
   - **Techniques**: Text cleaning, feature extraction (Bag-of-Words, N-grams, TF-IDF, topic modeling), similarity measurement, and hierarchical clustering with dendrograms.
   - **Outcome**: Structured text features and a dendrogram visualization that reveals document similarities and clusters.
